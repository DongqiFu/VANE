# VANE: View-Adversarial Multi-View Network Embedding
This repository is for the CIKM' 2020 paper "A View-Adversarial Framework for Multi-View Network Embedding" ([Link](https://dongqifu.github.io/publications/VANE.pdf)).

## Functionality
Given a multi-view network, VANE is able to produce view-invariant and robust node embeddings via two adversarial games.

## Reference
If you use the materials from this repositiory, please refer to our paper.
